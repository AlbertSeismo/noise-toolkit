V.2.0.0 2020-11-16 Python 3, use of Fedcatalog, adoption of CSD changes and adoption of PEP 8 style guide
V.0.9.5 2017-01-18 support for reading data and metadata from files only with no Internet requirement
V.0.9.0 2016-11-01 added support for obtaining channel responses from local station XML response files by introducing the following two functions in tsLIB.py:
                       getResponseInventory - to build a list of response inventories under a given met directory
                       getResponseFromFile - to find response for a given Network, Station, Location and channel
                       added respDirectory to common.py parameter file to disable looking for response files on local drives, set this parameter to None. Otherwise, set it to the response directory path
V.0.8.2 2016-01-25 added polarization parameters to common.par and also made changes to some libraries in support of the polarization bundle
                   added user and password parameters to common.par and ntk_computePSD.py in support of restricted data access
V.0.8.1 2015-04-30 added powerDirectory and imageDirectory parameters to common.par in support of ME bundle.
V.0.8.0 2015-04-07 added check for all parameter values to inform user if they are not defined. Corrected the instrument correction for SAC files that would apply
                        sensitivity in addition to instrument correction
        2015-04-06 addressed the variable maximum period issue that was changing based on the smoothing window length
        2015-04-02 based on feedback from Robert Anthony, in addition to nan values other non-numeric values may exist. The write that contains a flot() conversion
                   is placed in a try block so we can catch any non-numeric conversion issue and report it as user-defined NAN
V.0.7.2 2015-03-30 added a check to number of samples to avoid log of zero (reported by Rob Anthony)
V.0.7.1 2015-03-17 added the "waterLevel" parameter to provide user with more control on how the ObsPy module shrinks values under water-level of max spec amplitude 
                   when removing the instrument response. 
V.0.7.0 2015-02-24 introduced two new parameters (performInstrumentCorrection, applyScale) to allow user avoid instrument correction also now user can turn od decon. filter
V.0.6.0 2014-10-22 supports Windows installation and moved data, param and bin directory from IRIS_NTK/PSD to IRIS_NTK in preparation for Microseism Energy bundle release
V.0.5.0 2014-10-17 Beta release
